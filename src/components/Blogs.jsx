                        In React, controlled components refer to the components that are controlled by React state, meaning their state is updated by React. On the other hand, uncontrolled components refer to the components that handle their own state internally and do not rely on React to update their state. The key difference between the two is that with controlled components, React handles the state, while with uncontrolled components, the component handles its own state. This makes controlled components more predictable and easier to test, while uncontrolled components provide more flexibility and require less code.</p>

                    <p>React provides a built-in library called PropTypes that allows developers to validate the props being passed to a component. PropTypes provides a way to check the type, presence, and shape of the props being passed. To use PropTypes, we need to import the library and specify the propTypes object on the component. The propTypes object should contain a key for each prop that we want to validate and the value of that key specifies the validation rule. If the validation rule fails, a warning will be logged to the console. Using PropTypes can help catch bugs early and make the code more maintainable.</p>

                    <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is designed to be used for building scalable network applications.

                        Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible way to create web applications and APIs by providing features such as routing, middleware, and templates.

                        In other words, Node.js is the runtime environment for JavaScript code to run on the server-side, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js to simplify building web applications and APIs.</p>
